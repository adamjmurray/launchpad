Launchpad objects for Max 5 and Max for Live
version 1.0

by Adam Murray


------------------------
INSTALLATION

Put this folder somewhere on your Max search path (see Options -> File Preferences)

Get started with the help patches for launchpad.in and launchpad.out.


------------------------
ABOUT

The goal is to make it easier to customize the Launchpad by hiding the details of the MIDI protocol.
Simply think in terms of button position and color:
- homogeneous 9x9 grid (it doesn't distinguish the topmost row from other buttons)
- 7 states per button: dim and bright versions of green, amber, and red; or off

[ launchpad.in ] receives column and row index when you press/release buttons

[ launchpad.out ] turns buttons on or off, sets color per button


------------------------
TROUBLESHOOTING

Not working? Try this:
- Connect the Launchpad before starting the Max 5 application
- Hit the user1 or user2 button on the Launchpad
